### **Construction of Univariate and Bivariate Frequency Distributions**

Now, let’s delve into frequency distributions, a key method for organizing raw data into a structured format.

### **1. Univariate Frequency Distribution**

A **univariate frequency distribution** summarizes the frequency of a single variable.

#### **Steps to Construct a Univariate Frequency Distribution**

1. **Collect Raw Data**:
    
    - Example: Marks obtained by 20 students:  
        `45, 50, 55, 50, 60, 45, 70, 55, 65, 60, 50, 70, 80, 85, 55, 90, 45, 60, 70, 85`
2. **Decide Class Intervals**:
    
    - Choose suitable intervals (equal width).
    - Example: `40–49, 50–59, 60–69, etc.`
3. **Tally Frequencies**:
    
    - Count how many data points fall into each class interval.
    - Example:
        - `45 → 40–49`
        - `50 → 50–59`
4. **Create a Frequency Table**:
    
    - Example:

|**Class Interval**|**Frequency**|
|---|---|
|40–49|3|
|50–59|5|
|60–69|4|
|70–79|3|
|80–89|3|
|90–99|2|

#### **Cumulative Frequency** (Optional)

- Adds up frequencies progressively.
- Example:

|**Class Interval**|**Frequency**|**Cumulative Frequency**|
|---|---|---|
|40–49|3|3|
|50–59|5|8|
|60–69|4|12|
|70–79|3|15|
|80–89|3|18|
|90–99|2|20|

### **2. Bivariate Frequency Distribution**

A **bivariate frequency distribution** organizes data for two variables to study relationships between them.

#### **Steps to Construct a Bivariate Frequency Distribution**

1. **Collect Paired Data**:
    
    - Example: Heights (cm) and weights (kg) of 10 people:  
        `(160, 55), (165, 60), (170, 65), (160, 50), (165, 55), (170, 60), (175, 65), (180, 70), (160, 55), (170, 60)`
2. **Define Class Intervals for Both Variables**:
    
    - Heights: `160–169, 170–179, 180–189`
    - Weights: `50–59, 60–69, 70–79`
3. **Create a Two-Way Table**:
    
    - List one variable on rows and the other on columns.
4. **Fill Frequencies in Table**:
    
    - Count how many pairs fall into each combination of intervals.
    - Example:

|**Height \ Weight**|**50–59**|**60–69**|**70–79**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**160–169**|3|2|0|
|**170–179**|0|4|0|
|**180–189**|0|0|1|

### **Interpretation**

1. **Univariate Frequency Distribution**:
    
    - Focuses on the spread and frequency of a single variable.
    - Example: Helps understand the most common marks range in a class.
2. **Bivariate Frequency Distribution**:
    
    - Identifies relationships between two variables.
    - Example: Helps analyze whether taller people tend to weigh more.

### **Applications**

- **Univariate**: Used for histograms, pie charts, and cumulative frequency curves.
- **Bivariate**: Used for scatter plots, correlation analysis, and regression models.
