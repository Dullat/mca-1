### **1. Questionnaire**

#### **Definition**:

- A **questionnaire** is a structured set of questions designed to collect information from respondents.

#### **Steps to Design a Questionnaire**:

1. **Define the Objective**:
    
    - Clearly outline what you want to achieve.
    - Example: If studying consumer behavior, focus on purchase preferences and habits.
2. **Identify the Target Audience**:
    
    - Understand the group of people from whom data will be collected.
    - Example: If studying mobile phone usage, decide whether to survey teenagers, adults, or both.
3. **Structure the Questions**:
    
    - Start with simple, general questions and gradually move to more specific ones.
4. **Types of Questions**:
    
    - **Open-Ended Questions**:
        - Respondents provide detailed answers.
        - Example: "What features do you look for in a smartphone?"
    - **Closed-Ended Questions**:
        - Respondents choose from predefined options.
        - Example: "How often do you shop online? (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Never)"
    - **Likert Scale**:
        - Measures attitudes or opinions on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5).
        - Example: "How satisfied are you with the product? (1 = Very Dissatisfied, 5 = Very Satisfied)"
5. **Use Clear and Concise Language**:
    
    - Avoid technical jargon and ambiguous terms.
    - Example: Instead of "frequency," use "how often."
6. **Test the Questionnaire**:
    
    - Conduct a small pilot test to identify errors or confusing questions.

#### **Advantages of Questionnaires**:

- Easy to distribute to a large audience.
- Cost-effective for collecting quantitative data.

#### **Disadvantages**:

- Limited to literate respondents.
- Responses may lack depth or sincerity.

### **2. Schedule**

#### **Definition**:

- A **schedule** is similar to a questionnaire but involves a trained enumerator or researcher who fills out the form based on the respondentâ€™s answers during a face-to-face interview.

#### **Characteristics of a Schedule**:

- The enumerator reads out the questions and records the responses.
- The schedule is used when respondents are illiterate or when detailed data is required.

#### **Steps to Design a Schedule**:

1. **Define the Purpose**:
    
    - Similar to the questionnaire, determine what you want to achieve.
    - Example: Studying rural employment trends.
2. **Draft Clear and Precise Questions**:
    
    - Ensure questions are easy for the enumerator to explain.
3. **Provide Enumerator Training**:
    
    - Train the enumerators to avoid bias and ensure uniform data collection.
4. **Include Pre-Coded Responses (if applicable)**:
    
    - Helps in analyzing data faster.
    - Example: Yes/No questions.

#### **Advantages of Schedules**:

- Can reach respondents who cannot read or write.
- Responses tend to be more accurate as the enumerator clarifies doubts.

#### **Disadvantages**:

- Time-consuming and costly.
- Risk of enumerator bias.

### **Comparison Between Questionnaire and Schedule**

|**Aspect**|**Questionnaire**|**Schedule**|
|---|---|---|
|**Mode of Data Collection**|Self-administered by respondents|Administered by enumerators|
|**Cost**|Low|High|
|**Respondent Literacy**|Requires literacy|No literacy required|
|**Accuracy**|Depends on respondent interpretation|High, as enumerators clarify doubts|
|**Example**|Online survey form|Census data collection using schedules|

### **Example to Illustrate**

**Questionnaire**:

- A survey distributed online asking consumers about their spending habits.

**Schedule**:

- A government survey team visiting households to collect data on family income and expenditure.
