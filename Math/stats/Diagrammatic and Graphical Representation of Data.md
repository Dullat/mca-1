### **Diagrammatic and Graphical Representation of Data**

Representing data visually makes it easier to understand trends, comparisons, and relationships. This section introduces various diagrammatic and graphical methods used to display data.

---

### **1. Diagrammatic Representation**

Diagrams are simple visual tools to represent data. Common types include:

---

#### **a) Bar Diagram**

- Represents data using rectangular bars.
- Bars can be **horizontal** or **vertical**.
- **Types**:
    1. **Simple Bar Diagram**:
        - Represents one variable.
        - Example: Sales of a product over five years.
    2. **Multiple Bar Diagram**:
        - Represents two or more variables.
        - Example: Sales and profit of a company over years.
    3. **Sub-divided Bar Diagram (Stacked Bar)**:
        - Each bar is divided into segments showing parts of the total.
        - Example: Monthly expenses broken down into rent, food, and utilities.

---

#### **b) Pie Chart**

- Represents data as a circular chart divided into slices.
- Each slice corresponds to a category's proportion.
- **Use**: Best for showing relative proportions or percentages.
- Example: Market share of different companies.

---

#### **c) Histogram**

- Represents continuous data using adjacent rectangles (bars).
- **X-axis**: Represents class intervals.
- **Y-axis**: Represents frequency.
- **Difference from Bar Diagram**:
    - In histograms, bars touch each other because the data is continuous.

---

#### **d) Pictograms**

- Uses symbols or images to represent data quantities.
- Example: A pictogram showing the number of cars sold, where each car icon represents 10 cars.

---

#### **e) Line Diagram**

- A graph where points are plotted on a coordinate plane and joined with straight lines.
- **Use**: To show trends over time.
- Example: Tracking monthly temperatures.

---

### **2. Graphical Representation**

Graphs offer a more precise and detailed representation of data compared to diagrams.

---

#### **a) Line Graph**

- Represents data points over a timeline or continuous variable.
- Example: Daily stock prices of a company.

---

#### **b) Frequency Polygon**

- A line graph plotted by connecting midpoints of histogram bars.
- Represents frequency distribution.
- Example: Age distribution in a class.

---

#### **c) Ogive (Cumulative Frequency Curve)**

- Shows cumulative frequency distribution.
- Two types:
    1. **Less-than Ogive**: Plots cumulative frequency for values below a given class boundary.
    2. **More-than Ogive**: Plots cumulative frequency for values above a given class boundary.
- Example: Cumulative marks obtained by students.

---

#### **d) Scatter Plot**

- Represents the relationship between two variables.
- **X-axis**: One variable.
- **Y-axis**: Another variable.
- Example: Correlation between hours studied and exam scores.

---

#### **e) Time Series Graph**

- Represents data points at successive time intervals.
- Example: Population growth over decades.

### **Comparison: Diagrammatic vs. Graphical Representation**

|**Aspect**|**Diagrammatic Representation**|**Graphical Representation**|
|---|---|---|
|**Complexity**|Simple and easy to understand.|Detailed and precise.|
|**Purpose**|Broad visual summary.|Detailed relationships and trends.|
|**Examples**|Bar diagrams, pie charts.|Line graphs, scatter plots.|

### **Advantages of Diagrammatic and Graphical Representation**

1. Simplifies complex data.
2. Highlights trends, patterns, and outliers.
3. Easier to compare and interpret.
4. Makes data presentation visually appealing.
