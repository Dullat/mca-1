Great! Let’s move on to the **next topic: Concepts of Statistical Population and a Sample** in more detail.

### **1. Concepts of Statistical Population**

---
In statistics, the population is the entire set of items from which data is drawn in the statistical study. It can be a group of individuals or a set of items. The population is usually denoted by ****N.****

A sample is a subset of the population selected for study

---

#### **Definition**:

- A **statistical population** is the complete set of individuals, items, or events that share common characteristics and are of interest in a particular study.

#### **Types of Population**:

1. **Finite Population**:
    - A population with a limited number of elements.
    - Example: The number of employees in a company.
2. **Infinite Population**:
    - A population where counting all elements is impossible.
    - Example: The number of stars in the galaxy.
3. **Real Population**:
    - A population consisting of actual physical objects or individuals.
    - Example: All students in a school.
4. **Hypothetical Population**:
    - A population based on hypothetical or theoretical data.
    - Example: Possible outcomes of rolling a die infinitely.

### **2. Sample**

#### **Definition**:

- A **sample** is a subset of the population selected for analysis. It should represent the population accurately.

#### **Why Sampling is Necessary**:

- **Practicality**: Studying the entire population is often impossible due to time or cost constraints.
- **Efficiency**: A sample saves resources while providing meaningful insights.

#### **Key Points**:

- A sample must be **random** to avoid bias.
- It should be **large enough** to represent the population well.

### **Differences Between Population and Sample**

|**Aspect**|**Population**|**Sample**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|The entire group of interest in a study.|A subset of the population.|
|**Size**|Usually large or infinite.|Smaller and manageable.|
|**Example**|All students in a university.|200 randomly chosen students.|
|**Representation**|Contains all elements.|Represents only part of the population.|

---

### **3. Relation Between Population and Sample**

- A **sample** is drawn from the **population**.
- Inferences made about the **sample** are generalized to the **population** using statistical methods.

---

### Example to Illustrate:

- Suppose you want to study the **average height** of students in a university with 10,000 students.
    - **Population**: All 10,000 students.
    - **Sample**: 500 students randomly selected from the university.
