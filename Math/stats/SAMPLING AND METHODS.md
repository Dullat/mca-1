You're absolutely right! Based on the syllabus image, the next topic is **Sampling**, which includes:

1. Theoretical Basis of Sampling
2. Methods of Sampling

Let’s dive into **Sampling** systematically, starting with its theoretical basis.

### **What is Sampling?**

- **Definition**: Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals, items, or data points from a larger population to estimate the characteristics of the whole population.
- **Purpose**: It’s often used when studying the entire population (called a census) is impractical due to cost, time, or accessibility.

### **Theoretical Basis of Sampling**

1. **Population and Sample**:
    
    - **Population**:
        - Refers to the entire set of individuals or objects that share common characteristics.
        - Example: All students in a university.
    - **Sample**:
        - A smaller group selected from the population.
        - Example: 200 randomly chosen students from that university.
2. **Parameter vs. Statistic**:
    
    - **Parameter**:
        - A measure or characteristic of the entire population (e.g., population mean, population variance).
    - **Statistic**:
        - A measure or characteristic of a sample (e.g., sample mean, sample variance).
3. **Sampling Frame**:
    
    - The list or database from which the sample is drawn.
    - Example: A school’s attendance register used to select students for a survey.
4. **Sampling Error**:
    
    - The difference between the population parameter and the sample statistic.
    - **Minimization**:
        - Larger sample size.
        - Proper sampling techniques.
5. **Advantages of Sampling**:
    
    - **Time-Saving**: Studying a sample is quicker than studying the whole population.
    - **Cost-Effective**: Requires fewer resources.
    - **Feasibility**: Makes large-scale studies manageable.
6. **Disadvantages of Sampling**:
    
    - Sampling bias can occur if the sample is not representative.
    - Results may be less accurate than a census.

### **Methods of Sampling**

Sampling methods are broadly categorized into two types:

1. **Probability Sampling** (randomized)
2. **Non-Probability Sampling** (non-randomized)
3. [What Is Probability Sampling? | Types & Examples](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/probability-sampling/)

#### **1. Probability Sampling**

Every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected.

**Types**:

1. **Simple Random Sampling**:
    - Each member has an equal chance of being selected.
    - Example: Drawing names from a hat.
2. **Stratified Sampling**:
    - The population is divided into strata (subgroups), and samples are taken from each.
    - Example: Selecting students by gender or age group.
3. **Systematic Sampling**:
    - Every nn-th individual is chosen from a list.
    - Example: Selecting every 10th customer entering a store.
4. **Cluster Sampling**:
    - The population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected.
    - Example: Surveying all households in 5 randomly chosen neighborhoods.
5. **Multistage Sampling**:
    - A combination of two or more sampling methods.
    - Example: Using cluster sampling first, then simple random sampling within clusters.

#### **2. Non-Probability Sampling**

Members are selected based on non-random criteria, often relying on the judgment of the researcher.

**Types**:

1. **Convenience Sampling**:
    - Selecting participants who are easiest to access.
    - Example: Interviewing people in a nearby park.
2. **Judgmental Sampling**:
    - The researcher selects participants they deem fit.
    - Example: Surveying only experienced workers in a factory.
3. **Quota Sampling**:
    - Ensuring specific quotas (e.g., 50 men and 50 women) are met.
4. **Snowball Sampling**:
    - Existing participants recruit others to join the study.
    - Example: Networking-based surveys in rare disease studies.

### **Comparison: Probability vs. Non-Probability Sampling**

|**Aspect**|**Probability Sampling**|**Non-Probability Sampling**|
|---|---|---|
|**Basis of Selection**|Random|Non-Random|
|**Bias**|Less bias|More bias|
|**Applicability**|Large-scale surveys|Exploratory research|
|**Accuracy**|High|May lack accuracy|

### **Example Scenario**

- **Population**: All residents in a city.
- **Goal**: Estimate average monthly electricity usage.
- **Sampling Plan**:
    - Use **stratified sampling** to divide residents by income group.
    - Apply **random sampling** within each group.
