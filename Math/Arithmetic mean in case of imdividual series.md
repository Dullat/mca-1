### ShortCut Method

The Shortcut Method, also known as the Assumed Mean Method, is used to simplify the calculation of the arithmetic mean, especially when dealing with larger or more complex data sets. 

Here instead of summing all the data values directly, you use an assumed mean and work with deviations to simplify the process.
