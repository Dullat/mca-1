### individual
- Individual series isÂ **a series that shows the data individually**. It does not involve the class or frequency of the values, which means that in individual series, each variable is shown as a single variable or separately.

- Example: Scores of five students: 45, 50, 55, 60, 65.

- **Use**: Suitable when the number of observations is small and when each observation is unique.

### Discrete Series:

- Data is grouped into classes or categories, and each class has a corresponding frequency (how often each value occurs).

- Example: Number of students scoring marks: (45: 2 students, 50: 3 students, 55: 1 student).

- Use: This is used when data points are distinct and can be counted directly, like the number of occurrences.


### Continuous Series:

- Data is grouped into intervals or classes, where the observations are continuous. Frequencies are assigned to each class interval.

- Example: Marks range and frequencies: (40-50: 3 students, 50-60: 4 students, 60-70: 2 students).

- Use: Commonly used when data points are measurements (like heights, weights) and are spread over intervals.


Understanding these types will help you correctly identify and calculate measures like mean, median, and mode based on the nature of the data series.
