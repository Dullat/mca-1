# Program Control Instructions

Program control instructions are a crucial component of computer architecture, enabling the manipulation and modification of program flow. These instructions allow the computer to make decisions, implement loops, and execute subroutines, thereby facilitating the execution of complex algorithms.

## Types of Program Control Instructions

1. **Branch** (BR): Used for conditional jumps, allowing the program to change direction based on a condition.
2. **Jump** (JMP): Unconditional jumps to a specific location in memory.
3. **Skip** (SKP): Used in assembly languages, skipping a specific number of instructions.
4. **Return** (RET): Used to exit a subroutine and return control to the calling program.
5. **Compare** (CMP) and **Test** (TST): Used for conditional jumps based on the result of a comparison or test.
