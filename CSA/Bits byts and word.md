### Bits

- **Definition**: The smallest unit of data in computing, representing a binary value of either 0 or 1.
- **Usage**: Bits are the fundamental building blocks for all types of data, including integers, characters, and more.

### Bytes

- **Definition**: A byte consists of 8 bits. It is a standard unit for measuring data size.
- **Usage**: Bytes are often used to encode a single character in text (like ASCII) and serve as a basic unit for data storage and processing.

### Words

- **Definition**: A word is a unit of data that is processed as a single entity by the CPU. The size of a word can vary depending on the architecture (e.g., 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit).
- **Usage**: The word size determines how much data the CPU can handle at once, influencing performance and the maximum addressable memory space.

- **Data Types**: Different programming languages, including C, define various data types (like `int`, `char`, `float`), each with a specific size, typically measured in bytes.
- **Endianness**: The order in which bytes are arranged within a word can be either big-endian (most significant byte first) or little-endian (least significant byte first).
- **Memory Alignment**: Data types often require specific alignment in memory, which can affect performance and access speed.
