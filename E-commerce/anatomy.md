# Anatomy of E-Commerce Applications

## Multimedia Content for E-Commerce Applications

- **Definition**: Multimedia content is essential for e-commerce, functioning as both fuel and traffic. It encompasses various digital formats, including text, audio, video, images, graphics, numerical data, holograms, and animations.
  
- **Hardware Components**: The ability to access multimedia content relies heavily on the customer's hardware capabilities.

## Multimedia Storage Servers & E-Commerce Applications

- **Overview**: E-commerce requires robust multimedia storage servers that can handle large amounts of digital content, including books, newspapers, advertisements, movies, games, and medical images.

- **Server Functions**: These servers must ensure large-scale distribution, security, and reliability while serving information upon request.

### i. Client-Server Architecture in Electronic Commerce

- **Model Description**: E-commerce applications predominantly use the client-server model, where clients (devices and software) request information from servers through a message-passing paradigm.

- **Scalability**: The server manages application tasks, storage, security, and can scale to accommodate additional clients, from PDAs to PCs.

### ii. Internal Processes of Multimedia Servers

- **Functionality**: Multimedia servers convert raw data into usable information, capturing, processing, managing, and delivering text, images, audio, and video.

- **Performance Requirements**: These servers must support thousands of simultaneous users and often utilize high-end symmetric multiprocessors, clustered architectures, and massive parallel systems.

### iii. Video Servers & E-Commerce

- **Applications**: E-commerce applications related to digital video include:
  1. Telecommunication and video conferencing
  2. Geographic information systems for navigation
  3. Corporate multimedia servers
  4. Postproduction studios
  5. Shopping kiosks
  
- **Consumer Applications**: Video-on-demand services represent a key consumer application, connecting content providers (media) with transport providers (cable operators).

## Information Delivery/Transport & E-Commerce Applications

- **Transport Providers**: Key players include telecommunications, cable, and wireless industries.
  
### Information Transport Providers and Delivery Methods

- **Telecommunication Companies**: Long-distance and local telephone lines
- **Cable Television Companies**: Cable TV coaxial, fiber optic, and satellite lines
- **Computer-based Online Servers**: Internet and commercial online service providers
- **Wireless Communications**: Cellular and radio networks, paging systems

## Consumer Access Devices

### Information Consumers and Access Devices

- **Computers with Audio & Video Capabilities**: Personal and desktop computing, mobile computing
- **Telephonic Devices**: Videophones
- **Consumer Electronics**: Televisions with set-top boxes, game systems
- **Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)**: Pen-based and voice-driven computing
