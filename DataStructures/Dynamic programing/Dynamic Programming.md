## Dynamic Programming in DSA

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a fundamental technique in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results for future use.

## Key Characteristics:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: DP divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem, and combines the solutions to obtain the final answer.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: Subproblems may have some overlap, meaning that some subproblems may be identical or have similar solutions. DP stores the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
3. **Memoization**: DP uses a table or array to store the solutions to subproblems, allowing it to quickly retrieve and reuse previously computed solutions.

## Approaches:

1. **Top-Down DP (Memoization)**: Solves problems by recursively breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions in a memoization table.
2. **Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation)**: Builds a table or array by iteratively solving smaller subproblems and combining their solutions to obtain the final answer.

## Advantages:

1. **Efficient**: DP avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing solutions to subproblems.
2. **Scalable**: DP can handle large problem sizes by breaking them down into smaller, manageable subproblems.
3. **Flexible**: DP can be applied to a wide range of problems, including optimization, shortest paths, and matrix chain multiplication.

## Common Applications:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: DP is used to efficiently compute the Fibonacci sequence by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions.
2. **Shortest Paths**: DP is used to find the shortest path in a graph by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions.
3. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: DP is used to efficiently multiply a chain of matrices by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions.
