Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique used in algorithms and Data Structures to solve problems that involve optimal solutions and can be broken down into overlapping subproblems. The general approach to solving a problem using DP can be summarized in the following steps:

### 1. **Problem Decomposition (Identify Subproblems)**
   - Break down the original problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems. The key insight is that these subproblems are not independent but share common sub-subproblems.
   - The subproblems often involve finding the optimal solution for a given smaller instance of the problem.
   - Example: In the "Knapsack problem," for each item, we can either include it or exclude it, and we need to figure out the maximum value we can achieve for a given weight.

### 2. **Optimal Substructure**
   - Ensure that the solution to the original problem can be constructed from the solutions of its subproblems. This property is known as **optimal substructure**.
   - Example: In the "Fibonacci sequence," \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \). The solution to finding \( F(n) \) can be built by solving the smaller problems \( F(n-1) \) and \( F(n-2) \).

### 3. **Overlapping Subproblems**
   - In many DP problems, subproblems overlap, meaning the same subproblem is solved multiple times. This redundancy can be avoided by storing the results of subproblems in a **table** (usually an array or a hash map) to avoid recomputation.
   - This is what distinguishes DP from naive recursion.

### 4. **Memoization vs Tabulation**
   There are two main approaches to implementing DP:

   - **Memoization (Top-Down Approach)**:  
     - This is a recursive approach where you start solving the problem at the top (the original problem) and break it down into subproblems recursively. As you solve each subproblem, you store the result in a cache (usually an array or a hash map) to avoid recomputing it.
     - **Time complexity**: Typically \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the number of subproblems.

   - **Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)**:  
     - Instead of using recursion, this approach iteratively fills up a table (usually an array) from the base case upwards, solving all subproblems in a non-recursive manner.
     - **Time complexity**: Typically \( O(n) \), as you fill the table once and use the results to solve larger problems.

### 5. **State Definition (Formulate DP Table)**
   - Define a state that represents a subproblem in a table. The state should encapsulate all the necessary information to solve the subproblem.
   - Example: In the "0/1 Knapsack problem," a state can be defined as `dp[i][w]`, where:
     - `i` represents the first `i` items.
     - `w` represents the capacity of the knapsack.
     - `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value we can achieve with the first `i` items and a knapsack of capacity `w`.

### 6. **Recurrence Relation**
   - Identify how to compute the solution to a subproblem in terms of previously computed solutions (smaller subproblems). This step defines the recurrence relation.
   - Example (for the Fibonacci sequence):  
     \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \), where \( F(0) = 0 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \).

### 7. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Define the base case or boundary conditions for the smallest subproblems. These are typically trivial cases that can be solved directly.
   - Example (in the Fibonacci sequence): \( F(0) = 0 \), \( F(1) = 1 \).

### 8. **Solution Extraction**
   - After filling the DP table, extract the solution to the original problem from the table.
   - Example: In a typical knapsack problem, the solution will be at `dp[n][W]` where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the maximum weight capacity.

### General Template for DP Problems
- **Top-Down (Memoization):**
  ```python
  def solve(n, ...):
      # Use memoization (cache or dict)
      if n in memo:
          return memo[n]
      # Compute the result recursively
      result = min/max/other_function(solve(n-1), solve(n-2), ...)
      memo[n] = result
      return result
  ```

- **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):**
  ```python
  def solve(n, ...):
      dp = [0] * (n+1)  # or a 2D table for more complex problems
      dp[0] = base_case
      for i in range(1, n+1):
          dp[i] = min/max/other_function(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)
      return dp[n]
  ```

### Example Problems
1. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - A classic DP problem where you want to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
   - **Recurrence Relation**: \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)
   - **Base Cases**: \( F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 \)

2. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**
   - You are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a weight capacity. The goal is to determine the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack without exceeding the weight limit.
   - **Recurrence Relation**:  
     \( dp[i][w] = \max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-weight[i]] + value[i]) \)

3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**
   - Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence that is common to both sequences.
   - **Recurrence Relation**:  
     If \( A[i] == B[j] \):  
     \( dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 \)  
     Else:  
     \( dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) \)

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Usually \( O(n \cdot m) \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are the dimensions of the DP table (size of subproblems). For problems with 1D arrays, this reduces to \( O(n) \).
- **Space Complexity**: If the problem involves a 2D table, the space complexity is typically \( O(n \cdot m) \). If you can optimize the space (like using a rolling array or reducing the dimensions), this can often be reduced to \( O(n) \).

### Conclusion
Dynamic Programming is about breaking down a problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solving each of them optimally. With DP, you can significantly improve the time complexity of recursive solutions by storing and reusing results, making it a crucial technique for optimization problems in competitive programming and real-world problem-solving.
