Yes, **Heapify** and **Heap Sort** are related concepts but they are not the same. Let's break them down:

### 1. **Heapify**:
Heapify is a process used to **maintain the heap property** in a binary heap data structure. A binary heap can either be a **max-heap** or a **min-heap**:

- In a **max-heap**, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
- In a **min-heap**, the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the values of its children.

The heapify process is used in two main contexts:
- **Building a heap**: Converting an unsorted array into a valid heap. This can be done in O(n) time using a bottom-up approach.
- **Maintaining the heap property**: After removing an element (typically the root of the heap), heapify is used to restore the heap property.

When you **heapify** a subtree, you start from a node and "sift down" to ensure that the heap property is preserved. If the subtree rooted at a given node violates the heap property, heapify moves that node down and continues the process recursively or iteratively.

### 2. **Heap Sort**:
Heap Sort is a **sorting algorithm** that uses the heap data structure to sort elements. The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Build a max-heap** (or min-heap, depending on the desired order).
2. **Extract the root** of the heap (which will be the largest element in a max-heap or the smallest in a min-heap) and place it at the end of the array.
3. **Reduce the heap size** by one and then use heapify to restore the heap property.
4. Repeat the extraction and heapifying process until the heap is empty, resulting in a sorted array.

### Key Differences:
- **Heapify** is a **procedure** used to build or maintain the heap structure, while **Heap Sort** is an **algorithm** that uses heapify to sort elements.
- Heapify operates on individual subtrees, ensuring they maintain the heap property. Heap Sort, on the other hand, involves repeatedly extracting the root element and reapplying heapify to sort the entire array.

### Summary:
- **Heapify** is an operation to maintain the heap property.
- **Heap Sort** is a sorting algorithm that uses heapify to sort an array.
