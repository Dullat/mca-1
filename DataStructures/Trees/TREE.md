## Tree Data Structure

A tree data structure is a hierarchical organization of nodes, connected by edges, used to store and retrieve data efficiently. Here are the essential terminologies and concepts:

- **Node**: Each vertex of a tree is a node, representing a data element or a group of elements.
- **Root**: The topmost node of a tree, serving as the starting point for traversals.
- **Parent Node**: A node that has an edge-sharing connection to a child node.
- **Child Node**: A sub-node of a parent node, connected via an edge.
- **Leaf**: The last node in a tree, having no child nodes.
- **Edge**: A connecting link between two nodes.
- **Sibling**: Nodes with the same parent node.
- **Height**: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node, calculated by counting the total number of edges.
- **Depth**: The number of edges from the root node to a given node, equal to the height minus 1.
- **Level**: Each step from the root to a leaf node, with the root at level 0 and subsequent nodes at increasing levels.

**Key Properties**

- **Hierarchical**: Trees organize data in a hierarchical manner, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Non-Linear**: Trees do not follow a linear sequence, enabling flexible data structures.
- **Connected**: Each node is connected to its parent and children via edges.

**Types of Trees**

- **Binary Tree**: A tree where each node has at most two child nodes (left and right).
- **N-ary Tree**: A tree where each node can have any number of child nodes.

**Applications**

- **File Systems**: Trees are used to organize files and directories.
- **Database Indexing**: Trees are employed to index data in databases for efficient querying.
- **Compilers**: Trees are used to represent the syntax of programming languages.

By understanding these fundamental concepts and terminologies, you’ll be well-equipped to work with tree data structures and leverage their benefits in various applications.
