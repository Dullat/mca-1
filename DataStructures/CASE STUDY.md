### **Case Study: Linear Search Algorithm**

#### **Problem Statement**
You are given an unsorted array of integers, and you need to find a target integer in this array. If the target is present, return its index; otherwise, return `-1`.

#### **Algorithm: Linear Search**

Linear search is a straightforward search algorithm that examines each element of the array sequentially until it finds the target or reaches the end of the array.

#### **Pseudocode:**

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

- **Input**: An array `arr` of size `n`, and a `target` value.
- **Output**: The index of the `target` if found, otherwise `-1`.

#### **Step-by-step Execution:**
1. **Start** at the first element of the array.
2. Compare each element with the `target` value.
3. If the current element equals the `target`, return the index.
4. If no match is found by the time we reach the last element, return `-1` (target not found).

### **Algorithm Analysis**

#### **Time Complexity Analysis**

Time complexity refers to the amount of time the algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size `n`.

- **Best Case**: The best case occurs when the `target` is found at the **first position** in the array. In this case, the algorithm will only need one comparison, resulting in constant time.
  - **Best Case Time Complexity**: O(1)
  
- **Worst Case**: The worst case occurs when the `target` is either at the **last position** in the array or not present at all. In both of these cases, the algorithm must check every element in the array, making `n` comparisons.
  - **Worst Case Time Complexity**: O(n)

- **Average Case**: On average, the algorithm will have to check half of the elements in the array (assuming the target is equally likely to be at any position).
  - **Average Case Time Complexity**: O(n)

So, for **linear search**, the time complexity in all cases (best, worst, and average) is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

#### **Space Complexity Analysis**

Space complexity refers to the amount of additional memory the algorithm needs, excluding the input.

- **Space Complexity**: The linear search algorithm only needs a constant amount of space to store the index variable `i` (in the loop), and a constant amount of space for the input array.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

Thus, **linear search** has constant space complexity because it does not require any additional data structures or extra memory that grows with input size.

### **Example Walkthrough**

Let's take an example with an array and a target value to demonstrate the algorithm in action.

#### **Example 1:**

- **Array**: [3, 5, 2, 9, 7]
- **Target**: 9

**Execution Steps**:
1. Compare `arr[0]` (3) with `target` (9) → No match.
2. Compare `arr[1]` (5) with `target` (9) → No match.
3. Compare `arr[2]` (2) with `target` (9) → No match.
4. Compare `arr[3]` (9) with `target` (9) → Match found at index 3.

**Output**: The target is found at index 3.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) = O(5) = O(1) (best case for this input scenario)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### **Example 2:**

- **Array**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- **Target**: 6 (which is not in the array)

**Execution Steps**:
1. Compare `arr[0]` (1) with `target` (6) → No match.
2. Compare `arr[1]` (2) with `target` (6) → No match.
3. Compare `arr[2]` (3) with `target` (6) → No match.
4. Compare `arr[3]` (4) with `target` (6) → No match.
5. Compare `arr[4]` (5) with `target` (6) → No match.
6. The loop ends without finding the target.

**Output**: The target is not found, so return `-1`.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) = O(5) = O(1) (since we checked every element)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### **Final Answer Structure for an Exam:**

**Problem**: Given an array and a target value, find the index of the target using linear search.

**Algorithm**: Linear search, which iterates through each element and compares it with the target.

**Time Complexity**:
- **Best Case**: O(1) (Target found in the first position)
- **Worst Case**: O(n) (Target found at the last position or not found at all)
- **Average Case**: O(n) (Assuming random distribution of the target)

**Space Complexity**: O(1) (No additional space is required apart from the input array)

**Conclusion**: Linear search is an intuitive but inefficient search algorithm for large datasets since it requires checking every element, leading to a time complexity of O(n). However, it has the advantage of being simple to implement and does not require additional space beyond the input array.
