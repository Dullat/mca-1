### Knapsack Problem: Overview

The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in combinatorial optimization. It involves selecting a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a specified weight capacity.

### Problem Definition

Given:
- A set of items, each with a weight \(w_i\) and a value \(v_i\).
- A maximum weight capacity \(W\).

The objective is to determine the maximum value \(V\) that can be carried in a knapsack without exceeding the weight limit \(W\).

### Types of Knapsack Problems

1. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**:
   - Each item can either be included (1) or excluded (0) from the knapsack.
   - Cannot take fractions of items.

2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**:
   - Items can be divided; you can take fractions of an item.
   - Allows a greedy approach.

### 0/1 Knapsack Problem

#### Dynamic Programming Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a 2D array `K` where \(K[i][w]\) represents the maximum value that can be achieved with the first \(i\) items and a weight limit of \(w\).

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If the weight of the \(i\)-th item \(w_i\) is less than or equal to \(w\):
     \[
     K[i][w] = \max(K[i-1][w], v_i + K[i-1][w - w_i])
     \]
   - Else:
     \[
     K[i][w] = K[i-1][w]
     \]

3. **Base Case**:
   - If there are no items or the weight capacity is 0:
     \[
     K[0][w] = 0 \quad \text{for all } w
     \]
     \[
     K[i][0] = 0 \quad \text{for all } i
     \]

4. **Final Solution**:
   - The maximum value can be found at \(K[n][W]\), where \(n\) is the number of items.

#### Example

Consider the following items:
- Item 1: Value = 60, Weight = 10
- Item 2: Value = 100, Weight = 20
- Item 3: Value = 120, Weight = 30

And a maximum weight capacity \(W = 50\).

**Dynamic Programming Table**:

| Item/Weight | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 10 | ... | 50 |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|-----|----|-----|----|
| 0           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 1           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 60 | ... | 60 |
| 2           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 60 | ... | 100 |
| 3           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 60 | ... | 160 |

The maximum value that can be carried is 220, which can be achieved by including Items 2 and 3.

### Fractional Knapsack Problem

#### Greedy Approach

1. **Item Value Density**:
   - Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item \(v_i / w_i\).

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort items based on this ratio in descending order.

3. **Greedy Selection**:
   - Start from the item with the highest ratio and take as much of it as possible until the knapsack is full.

#### Example

Given the same items as before but allowing fractions:

- Item 1: Value = 60, Weight = 10 (Ratio = 6)
- Item 2: Value = 100, Weight = 20 (Ratio = 5)
- Item 3: Value = 120, Weight = 30 (Ratio = 4)

**Sorting**:
1. Item 1 (6)
2. Item 2 (5)
3. Item 3 (4)

**Selection**:
- Take all of Item 1: Total Weight = 10, Total Value = 60.
- Take all of Item 2: Total Weight = 30, Total Value = 160.
- Take \( \frac{2}{3} \) of Item 3: Total Weight = 50, Total Value = 220.

### Conclusion

The Knapsack Problem is fundamental in combinatorial optimization, with both 0/1 and fractional versions offering different approaches to finding optimal solutions. Understanding its characteristics and solution methods is crucial for tackling various practical problems in resource allocation, budgeting, and logistics.

# fractional knapsack problem
If we allow fractional items (like in the fractional knapsack problem), we can take part of the third object. Let's calculate the total profit by including a fraction of the third item.

### Given Data

- **Profits**: {10, 14, 25, 20}
- **Weights**: {7, 15, 18, 20}
- **Bag Capacity**: 30

### Step 1: Add Full Objects by Weight

1. **Add Object 1**: Weight = 7, Profit = 10
   - Remaining Capacity = 30 - 7 = 23
   - Total Profit = 10

2. **Add Object 2**: Weight = 15, Profit = 14
   - Remaining Capacity = 23 - 15 = 8
   - Total Profit = 10 + 14 = 24

### Step 2: Add Fraction of Object 3

- **Add Part of Object 3**: Weight = 18, Profit = 25
- We can only take a fraction of this object since we have 8 units of capacity remaining.

To find out how much we can take:
- Fraction of Object 3 we can take = Remaining Capacity / Weight of Object 3
- \( \text{Fraction} = \frac{8}{18} \)

Calculating the profit from the fraction:
- Profit from fraction = \( \frac{8}{18} \times 25 = \frac{200}{18} \approx 11.11 \)

### Step 3: Calculate Total Profit

- Total Profit = Profit from Object 1 + Profit from Object 2 + Profit from fraction of Object 3
- Total Profit = \( 10 + 14 + 11.11 \approx 35.11 \)

### Conclusion

With the fractional part of Object 3 included, the total profit is approximately **35.11**. 

If you're looking for a specific total profit of **42.1**, it wouldn't be achievable with these weights and profits under the greedy weight-based approach, even allowing fractions.

# About profit
You're correct! Let's reevaluate the solution with a focus on maximizing profit, including the fractional part of Object 4 after adding Object 3.

### Given Data

- **Profits**: {10, 14, 25, 20}
- **Weights**: {7, 15, 18, 20}
- **Bag Capacity**: 30

### Step 1: Sort by Profit

Sorted by profit (descending):
1. Object 3: Profit = 25, Weight = 18
2. Object 4: Profit = 20, Weight = 20
3. Object 2: Profit = 14, Weight = 15
4. Object 1: Profit = 10, Weight = 7

### Step 2: Add Objects to the Knapsack by Profit

1. **Add Object 3**: Profit = 25, Weight = 18
   - Remaining Capacity = 30 - 18 = 12
   - Total Profit = 25

2. **Add Object 4**: Profit = 20, Weight = 20
   - Cannot add the full object (weight exceeds remaining capacity of 12).
   - We can take a fraction of Object 4:
     - Fraction = Remaining Capacity / Weight of Object 4 = \( \frac{12}{20} = 0.6 \)
     - Profit from fraction = \( 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \)

### Final Calculation

- **Total Profit**: 
  - From Object 3: 25
  - From fraction of Object 4: 12
- Total Profit = \( 25 + 12 = 37 \)

### Conclusion

With this correction, the total profit when being greedy about profit is **37**. If you're looking for a specific target of **42.1**, it still wouldn't be achievable with these weights and profits.
